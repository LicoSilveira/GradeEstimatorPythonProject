# Ask for the user's first name
first_name = input("Licurgo")

# Ask for the user's last name

# Explanatory comments
# 1. Asking the user to enter their first name and storing it in the variable first_name.
# 2. Asking the user to enter their last name and storing it in the variable last_name.
# 3. Printing the full name using an f-string to format the output.
